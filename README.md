A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

I love to absorb information, digest it, convert it into knowledge, change form, expel knowledge to once again become an empty vessel. 

This is wisdom!
